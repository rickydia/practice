		<link>
			links the css file with the html file

			requires href - should be set to path of css file, type - should be set to "text/css", rel - should be set to "stylesheet"

			<link

BASIC STRUCTURE AND SYNTAX
	the css selectore essentially matches the html tag for that element but w/o the angled brackets

	if wanting to select <h1>
		h1 {
		} 

	if wanting to select all
		* {
			font-family: Arial;
		}

	css declarations
		need two things within the selected html element
			property - the property you'd like to style

			value - the value of the property

			h1, h2, p {
				color: Green;
			}
