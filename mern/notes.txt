generating a node project
    cd $PROJECT
    npm init
        hit enter
install express
    npm install --save express

node - js runtime used to execute code outside of the browser
express - library that runs in the node runtime. has helpers that makes dealing with HTTP trafic easier

deployment checklist (DONE ONE TIME)
    dynamic port binding
        heroku will tell us which port out app will use, so we need to make sure we listen to the port they tell us to
            we did process.env.PORT
    specify node environment
        we want to use a specific version of node, so we need to tell heroku which version to use
            we put it in the package.json
                "engines": {
                  "node": "8.1.1",
                  "npm": "5.0.3"
                },
    specify start script
        instruct heroku what commande to run to start our server running
            we put it in the package.json
                "scripts": {
                  "start": "node index.js"
                },
    create .gitignore file
        we don't want to include dependencies, heroku will do that for us
            we ignores node_modules

first time deploy
    1. create heroku account
    2. commit our codebase to git
    3. install heroku CLI and create app
        heroku create
    4. deploy app with git
        get the second link that's outputted from prev command and push there
    5. heroku deploys project
subsequent deploys
    1. commit codebase with git
    2. deploy app with git
